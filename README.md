Citizen Journalism Mobile App, Website, and Eco-System


### Contributing To The Project

Under the hood it's all HTML, CSS, and JS. Phonegap (Cordova) is used to deploy to various mobile platforms.

Because the entire front-end and app is built with the same mark-up, styles, and events we make use of Grunt.js to handle:
- compiling sass files, jade templates
- minify everything
- writing everything once (as much as possible)

Check out the src/ folder for more details on how to contribute.
